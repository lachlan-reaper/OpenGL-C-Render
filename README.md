# OpenGL-C-Render

A quick simple rendering engine to be designed for later personal project light-weight use.

Orignially based on the [OpenGL tutorial for beginners](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials), later repurposed for private use.

Can be built (with a main func) using
```bash
make build
```

Can be run (with the main func) using
``` bash
make run
```
